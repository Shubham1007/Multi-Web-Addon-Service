The main objective of this extension is to help people accomplish their tasks fast and easily. It gets all useful add-ons in one place and performs numerous tasks with ease.
 
Web-Extensions=>

WebExtensions are a way to write browser extensions: that is, programs installed inside a web browser that modify the behaviour of the browser or of web pages loaded by the browser. They are built on a set of cross-browser APIs, so WebExtensions written for Google Chrome or Opera will in most cases run in Firefox or Edge too.


For an index of all the examples, see the "Example extensions" page on MDN.

The examples are made available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

Installing an example=>

There are a couple ways to try out the example extensions in this repository.

1) Open Firefox and load about:debugging in the URL bar. Click the Load Temporary Add-on button and select the manifest.json file within the directory of an example extension you'd like to install. Here is a video that demonstrates how to do this.

2) Install the web-ext tool, change into the directory of the example extension you'd like to install, and type web-ext run. This will launch Firefox and install the extension automatically. This tool gives you some additional development features such as automatic reloading.
